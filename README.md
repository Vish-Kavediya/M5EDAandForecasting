 EDA on Walmart M5 Competition Dataset and Forecasting 6 months of sales in stores of california
 
##Dataset
 There are two .rar files named EdaAndForecastingDataJN.rar and PowerBIdata.rar.
 **EdaAndForecastingDataJN.rar** - It contains all the csv files related to jupyter notebook. Please extract all the files in your working directory before running m5forecasting.
 **PowerBIdata.rar** - It contains csv files which are source for power bi(.pbix) file. Here I have sliced out data related to california state and melted it using pandas. This was necessary because when I was trying to melt the data in power bi using power query i was getting error of not enough memory on my pc.

##PBIX File
I have uploaded the .pbix file on google drive and here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jLu1beB6X5BtdGNuDWdbaAtr9jqvmDo1?usp=share_link) . This was done because github has file limit of 100 MB and .pbix file is of 172 MB. Please download using the link to use the power bi dashboard.
I have performed ABC classification and Demand Segmentation using DAX queries in POWER BI. It also contains 6 months ahead forecast done using python and power inbuilt functions. 
It contains lots of beautiful visuals and insights.Please check out the Power Bi Dashboards.
There is also screenshots of varios pages of PowerBi Dashboard in "PowerBI Dashboard Images".
